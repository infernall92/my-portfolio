        I am a front-end developer passionate about building intuitive and
        visually appealing user interfaces. My goal is to grow by working on
        challenging projects, staying updated with the latest technologies, and
        creating impactful solutions.

      <p>
        Iâ€™ve built my skills through various courses and academies, including
        Udemy, where I gained a strong foundation in{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-300">HTML</span>,{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-300">CSS</span>,{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-300">JavaScript</span>, and{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-300">frameworks</span> like{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-300">React</span> and{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-300">Next.js</span>. These experiences have
        equipped me with the knowledge to develop{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-300">modern</span> and{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-300">responsive</span> web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am part of a team as a{" "}

        working on a{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-300">Web3 startup project</span>. This role
        has helped me understand the development flow, gain experience with{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-300">GIT</span> and{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-300">Jira</span>, and observe how a team
        approaches the creation of a web application from the ground up.
